# Introduction
Dear Committee Head, Dear Experts,

My name is Daniel David Kovacs.

## A little bit about my background
I have been trained both as an architect and as software engineer; although it may seem like a minute detail, I think this fact does deeply influence my thought process.

## About my recent role
This is my third year at Epam as software engineer. After a few in/house projects I have become a member of the Hotels.com project focusing on backend services for mobile applications.

### Technological achievements
I am particularly proud of my contributikn to our team's mobile api service. Its role is to provide edge services to mobile applications via thin stateless Rest services with the occasional facade-like aggregate logic. I have taken part in the creation of a multi module maven archetype, whose latest iteration now serves as an architectural foundation for upcoming mobile services. 

As part of this archetype there is a build time integration test in place. I consider this my brain child, and I am lucky to say that it has proven itself useful a number of times. In essense it deploys the webapp in a separate jvm instance and the test methods perform actual http requests against the webapp. A particularly interesting problem that had to be solved stemmed from the fact that we are required to integrate componenets outside of our ownership that sit at the seams of our code. Despite the regular Spring profile mechanism being ommitted from these components I have managed to put in place a mechanism to replace them with mocks to enable efficient integration testing.

This also serves the basis of our currentoy formulating testing strategy in CI environment.

I am also proud of the structure of some of the team's plugin-like projects. Due to rather volatile specifications and requirements they quite frequently had to endure alterations. I am happy to say that in most of such cases it was sufficient to execute changes in the configuration, or occasionally only a minimal amount of code had to be added. To me this shows that I have managed to create a level of a straction and loose coupling in that project structure that is a good match to its evolving environment allthewhile this not hindering the ease of understanding of the project in its entirety.


### My roles in mentoring and leadership
The most recent project in the mobile core team has been the cross-device shortlist service for mobile apps. In short, just to put it in perspective we provide an edge service between mobile applications and the more general customer data store backend. 

I have been tasked to lead this project within a 'sub-team' with the two newest members of the pod. This project has been ideal for ramping up the juniors with real tasks. 

The shortlist project can also be viewed as a proving ground to coordinate with the client and the owner of the backend service we rely on. 



### Self improvement
I place great importance on self improvement by reading technical books and articles. My interests have a broad spectrum, yet I make it a point to also read materials that feed directly into my daily work. 



## Why I think I am a viable candidate for D3 level
To my mind - on the technical side - it is not enough for a level 3 developer to have an appropriate skills, but also an inner drive to constantly enhance their knowledge. Even more importantly they should readily share their knowledge both in the form of trainings and casual shop-talk. I feel that I have demonstrated this in my day to day work as well as in my participation of the team's juniors' ramp up sessions.
