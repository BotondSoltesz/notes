### Objects
- **Objects** are made up of
    - data (file)
    - default metadata (e.g. version)
    - standard http metadata
    - custom metadata defined when storing objects
- Every Object is stored in a **Bucket**
- Objects within a Bucket are uniqely identified by a key

### Buckets
- **Buckets** hold **Objects**
- Buckets are the unit of aggregation for usage reporting
- Name of a Bucket is unique accross all S3 accounts
- Access control is managed on a per Bucket basis
- Buckets can be configured to be region-specific
- An account may have multiple Buckets
- Useful for organizing Objects into namespaces

### Regions

- optimize latency
- minimize costs
- address regulatory requirements

    - users
    - groups
    - S3 Buckets
- Policies allow for centralized management

## Glacier
