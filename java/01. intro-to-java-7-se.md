# Intro to Java 7 SE

## Inheritance
Inheritnce creates ancestor-descendant hierarchy. Ancestor becomes part of descendant;
descendant can override, extend, or keep behaviour of parent.

### Use inheritance for software reuse
Inheritance aids in code reuse when common elements of multiple classes are placed in a common ancestor; thus shared code becomes available for descendants.

### Use inheritance for refinement or specialisation of an existing class
Descendants may override non-final, visible methods of ancestors. Overridden method may be completely new, or depend on the parent implementation via `super.`. Such refinement and specialisation is powered polymorphism via dynamic binding. 

### Understand the issue of multiple inheritance
Multiple inheritance is not allowed in Java to prevent the diamond problem. Example:

		class A {
			foo(){...}
			bar(){... foo(); ...}
		}

		class B extends A {
			@Override foo(){...}
		}
		
		class C extends A {
			@Override foo(){...}
		}
		
		//assume multiple inheritance is legal
		class D extends B, C {
		}

		A a = new D();
		a.bar(); --> ambiguous if B.foo() or C.foo() is called.

### Usages of the final modifier
`final` modifier may appear in 

- class definitions

	class cannot be subclassed
	example:


	    public final class A {
	    }
		
- method definitions
	
	method cannot be overridden
	example:


	    public final int foo() {
	    }
		
- fields, local variables, method parameters

	cannot change value once assigned

	**NB!** Method parameters are passed by value:

    - for primitive types this means a copy, final modifier is stylistic only;
    - for objects this means that the reference to the object is copied - if object is passed as final, value of the reference cannot be changed; this does not mean though that class itself is immutable


        private final String string = "I am a string constant";

        public void foo(final int i, final String s){
            final int j = 10;
        }

### Abstract classes
- abstract classes serve as classes designed to be inherited from
- abstract classes cannot be instantiated
- useful when adhering to the principle of coding to interfaces

In the example both circle and square *IS-A* shape:

        public abstract class Shape {
            private final int centerX;
            private final int centerY;

            public Shape(final int x, final int y) {
                this.centerX = x;
                this.centerY = y;
            }

            public abstract void draw();
        }

        public class Circle extends Shape {
            private final int radius;

            public Circle(final int x, final int y, final int r) {
                super(x,y);
                this.radius = r;
            }

            @Override
            public void draw() {
                // draw a circle
            }
        }

        public class Square extends Shape {
            private final int side;

            public Circle(final int x, final int y, final int side) {
                super(x,y);
                this.side = side;
            }

            @Override
            public void draw() {
                // draw a square
            }
        }

        Shape circle = new Circle(1,2,3);
        Shape square = new Square(1,2,3);

### Interfaces
- interfaces declare a contract for classes implementing them
- they contain no method implementation except for default methods from Java8;
- default methods are marked with the keyword `default`
- default methods allow us to extend interfaces without breaking existing implementations
- may contain fields, but that is not considered good practice
- since interfaces declare contract only without implementation, a class is allowed to implement multiple interfaces
- an implementing class *IS-A* interface

### Understand the importance of interfaces
- promotes loose coupling between components
- code reuse through composition
- coding to an interface binds to contract, not behaviour; thus concrete pieces implementations act as interchangable components
- implementing multiple interfaces provides good workaround to the lack of multiple inheritance

### Compare interfaces and abstract classes
| Interfaces | Abstract classes |
| --- | --- |
| class can implement multiple interfaces | class can extend a single (abstract) class |
| no behaviour, contract only | base behaviour to be specialized or refined |
| is a something that acts according to a contract | a data type that may encapsulate some behaviour |
| cannot be instantiated | cannot be instantiated |
| can be extended | can be extended |

## Nested Classes
Nested classes are classes within classes. There are two kinds:
- non-static nested classes called *inner classes*


        class OuterClass {

            public SomeInterface instantiateAnonymousClass() {
                return new SomeInterface(final String person) {
                    @Override
                    public String apply() {
                        return "Hello " + person;
                    }
                }
            }

            // local class
            class InnerClass {

            }
        }

- static nested classes called *static nested classes*

        class OuterClass {
            static class NestedClass {
            }
        }

### Inner Classes
- an inner classes are associated with an instance of its enclosing class
- inner class has access to enclosing object's methods and fields
- cannot define static members
- instantiation requires the existence of the enclosing class


        OuterClass.InnerClass innerObject = outerObject.new InnerClass();

- Local classes are a special kind of inner class declared in a block
- Anonymous classes are a special kind of inner class
- Local and Anonymous classes have access to finals of enclosing scope
- Serialization of inner classes, including local and anonymous classes, is strongly discouraged

### Nested Static Classes
- nested static classes is associated with its outer class
- nested static classes can only refer to the enclosing class's instance variables through object reference
- static nested classes interact with instance members of the outer class just like any other top-level class
- instantiation does not require an instance of the enclosing class


        OuterClass.NestedClass nestedObject = new Outerclass.NestedClass();

### Difference between a nested class and a member class
- Member class is an onther name for Inner class
- Nested class is any enclosed class

### Create and use an anonymous class
See example

### Anonymous inner classes
Instantiation of interface or abstract class with in place implenentation.

## Exceptions
An exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of instructions.

             +-----------+
             | Throwable |
             +-----------+
                   A
                   |
         +---------+---------+
         |                   |
     +-------+         +-----------+
     | Error |         | Exception |
     +-------+         +-----------+
                             A
                             |
                    +------------------+
                    | RuntimeException |
                    +------------------+

- Throwable: ancestor of objects that can be throw and caught - not an interface so that it has a state by design
- Error: indicates serious problems that a reasonable application should not try to catch
- Exception: checked; meant to be caught or declared with `throws` if not handled
- RuntimeException: unchecked; does not have to be declared with `throws` even when unhandled

### Use exceptions to indicate an error
- superior to `goto error`, invalid or null return values, ad-hoc error handling code
- use of exceptions separate normal code and error handling code
- allows for the propagation of errors up the call stack
- allows for the grouping of error types

### Handle exceptions

    try(AutoCloseableImplementation resource = resourceFactory.createResource()) {
        resource.doSomethingNasty();
    } catch (SomeException | OtherException e) {
        log.error(e.stackTrace());
        throw new WrapperException(e);
    } finally {
        alwaysExecuteMe();
    }

### Interpret a stacktrace
Contains
- the exception
- description of the exception
- call stack with classes
- methods
- line numbers where a given exception has been raised.

Example:

        Caused by: javax.persistence.PessimisticLockException: could not obtain pessimistic lock
                at org.hibernate.ejb.AbstractEntityManagerImpl.wrapLockException(AbstractEntityManagerImpl.java:1439)
                at org.hibernate.ejb.AbstractEntityManagerImpl.convert(AbstractEntityManagerImpl.java:1324)
                at org.hibernate.ejb.AbstractEntityManagerImpl.find(AbstractEntityManagerImpl.java:828)

### Use the finally block approprietly
Finally block executes regardles of the outcome of the try block. When working with an AutoCloseable resource, try with resources is a superior option. Otherwise use finally block to free resourecs. See example.

### Use the try-with-resource statement
See Example.

### Avoid exception swallowing
Exception is swallowed if the catch branch does nothing to handle the exception. Antipattern, avoid.

### Understand the benefits of Exception Handling
See 'Use exceptions to indicate an error'

### Prefer unchecked exceptions
- checked vs unchecked according to oracle Java documentation
    > If a client can reasonably be expected to recover from an exception, make it a checked exception. If a client cannot do anything to recover from the exception, make it an unchecked exception
- checked exceptions become part of the interface contract, makes it harder to add new exceptions without breaking contract

## Collections and Generic Types
### Use the interfaces of the collection framework
TODO! example code

### Collection
Collection is the top level interface in the collection framework. Its descendant interfaces are

- Set
- List
- Map
- Deque

Basic implementations are not thread safe, concurrent wrappers are available for each implementation.

### Set, SortedSet
Set elements are unique. Uniquness is decided via the equals() and hash() methods. SortedSet adds an ordering of the elements over the Set interface.

Implementing classes are

- HashSet backed by a hash table
- TreeSet sorted set backed by a balanced tree, basic operations (add, remove, contains) are guaranteed to be O(log n)
- LinkedHashSet backed by hash table with the elements doubly linked. Maintains insertion order on iteration over elements

### List
List elements are addressable by their position.

Implementing classes are
- ArrayList backed by resizeable array
- LinkedList backed by doubly linked list; performance is as expected from linked lists, accessing of an element triggers a traversal from the beginning or the end of the list

### Queue
Deque (doubly ended queue) supports adding and removing elements at both ends.

Implementing classes are
- ArrayDeque backed by resizeable array. Most operations are amortized O(1), remove, contains, and bulk operations are O(n)
- LinkedList backed by doubly linked list; indexing into the list triggers traversal

### Map, SortedMap
Maps store key-value pairs, elements addressable by key.

Implementing classes are
- HashMap backed by bucket hash; order of elements is not guaranteed to be unchanged over operation; constructor has two optional parameters
    - capacity: number of buckets
    - load factor: maximum number of entries over number of buckets

**NB!** when the actual capacity exceeds load factor, the table is resized and rehashed; good performance is also dependent on the hash function; should produce even distribution for the entries among the buckets.

- TreeMap backed by red-black tree; order of entries is according to the natural ordering of the keys. containsKey, get, put, remove are O(log n)

### Use the common collection and map implementations
TODO! example code

### How to use an iterator
Iterators provide a concise way of traversing elements of a collection. Basic usage is

    Iterator iterator = myCollection.iterator();
    while(iterator.hasNext()) {
        Object o = iterator.next();
        if (foo(o)) {
            iterator.remove();
        }
    }

Collection framework's Iterators are *fail-fast*, meaning that any modification on the backing collection except for removal of an element via itertor.remove() will throw  ConcurrentModificationException.

ListIterator is an iterator for lists that allow the traversal of lists in both directions.

### Order elements of a collection
- use a sorted collection, such as TreeSet or TreeMap
- use Collections.sort() on a list; sorts by natural ordering of its elements or with Comparator passed as argument. Modifies list.

### Use the Collections utility class
TODO! example code

### Develop generic types
- Generic types are supported via Type parameters.
- PECS: producer extends, consumer super


        public class GenericStore<T> {
            private Object store[] = new Object[10];
            private int lastItem = -1;

            public void putAll(List<? extends T> source) {
                for(T item : source) {
                    if (lastItem < store.length -1) lastItem++;
                    store[lastItem] = item;
                }
            }

            public void getAll(List<? super T> dest) {
                for (int i = 0; i <= lastItem; i++) {
                    dest.add(i, (T) store[i]);
                }
            }
        }

        public void genericStoreTest() {
            GenericStore<Number> numberStore = new GenericStore<Number>();
            List<Integer> ints = Arrays.asList(Integer.valueOf(1), Integer.valueOf(2), Integer.valueOf(3));
            List<Double> doubles = Arrays.asList(Double.valueOf(1.5), Double.valueOf(2.5), Double.valueOf(3.5));

            numberStore.putAll(ints);
            numberStore.putAll(doubles);

            List<Number> numberBuffer = new ArrayList<Number>();
            numberStore.getAll(numberBuffer);

            for(Number number : numberBuffer) {
                System.out.println(number + " : " + number.getClass());
            }
            System.out.println("---");
            for(Object object : numberBuffer) {
                System.out.println(object + " : " + object.getClass());
            }
        }

        /*
        1 : class java.lang.Integer
        2 : class java.lang.Integer
        3 : class java.lang.Integer

        2.5 : class java.lang.Double

        2.5 : class java.lang.Double
        3.5 : class java.lang.Double
        */

- on `putAll()` the **least** known about stored elements is that they are Number-s; Integer extends Number, Double extends Number;
- on `getAll()` the **most** that is known about retrieved elements is that they are Number-s; Number super Number, Object super Number;

### Understand type erasure
- byte code does not contain generics, no runtime overhead
- type parameters are replaced by their bounds or `Object`
- type casts are added when necessary

type erasure of generic classes with **unbounded type parameters**

        public class Node<T> {
            private T data;
            private Node<T> next;

            public Node(T data, Node<T> next) {
                this.data = data;
                this.next = next;
            }

            public T getData() {
                return data;
            }

becomes

        public class Node {
            private Object data;
            private Node next;

            public Node(Object data, Node next) {
                this.data = data;
                this.next = next;
            }

            public Object getData() {
                return data;
            }

type erasure of generic classes with **bounded type parameters**

        public class Node<T extends Comparable<T>> {
            private T data;
            private Node<T> next;

            public Node(T data, Node<T> next) {
                this.data = data;
                this.next = next;
            }

            public T getData() {
                return data;
            }

becomes

        public class Node {
            private Comparable data;
            private Node next;

            public Node(Comparable data, Node next) {
                this.data = data;
                this.next = next;
            }

            public Comparable getData() {
                return data;
            }

type erasure of generic methods

        public static <T> int count(T[] array, T element) {
            int count = 0;
            for(T e : array) {
                if (e.equals(element)) count+= 1;
            }
            return count;
        }

becomes

        public static int count(Object[] array, Object element) {
            int count = 0;
            for(Object e : array) {
                if (e.equals(element)) count+= 1;
            }
            return count;
        }

Bridge methods are synthetic methods generated when a class or interface extends a parametrized class or interface. Consider the example

        public class Node<T> {
            private T data;

            public void setData(T data) {
                this.data = data;
            }
        }

        public class MyNode extends Node<Integer> {
            @Override
            public void setData(Integer data) {
                //...
                super.setData(data);
            }
        }

after type erasure

        public class Node {
            private Object data;

            public void setData(Object data) {
                this.data = data;
            }
        }

        public class MyNode extends Node {

            // method signature missmatch
            @Override
            public void setData(Integer data) {
                //...
                super.setData(data);
            }
        }

Notice that signatures do not match. Hence the generated bridge method

        public class MyNode extends Node {

            // bridge method generated by compiler
            @Override
            public void setData(Object data) {
                setData((Integer) data);
            }

            public void setData(Integer data) {
                //...
                super.setData(data);
            }
        }

### Non-reifiable types
- reifable type: type information is fully available at runtime; such are
    - primitives
    - non-generic types
    - raw types
    - invocation on unbound wildcards

- non-reifiable type: some information on the type has been removed at compile time, such as generic types not defined as unbounded wildcards.

    Thus List<String> and List<Number> are the same at runtime; the JVM cannot tell the difference

- heap pollution: a parametrized type refers to an object that is not of that parameterized type; this may happen when mixing raw and parametrized types. Heap pollution can be prevented if program compiles without *unchecked* warnings.

Heap pollution example with varargs methods with non-reifiable formal parameters

    public class ArrayBuilder {

        public static <T> void addToList(List<T> listArg, T... elements) {
            for (T x : elements) {
                listArg.add(x);
            }
        }

        public static void faultyMethod(List<String>... l) {
            Object[] objectArray = l;   // valid
            objectArray[0] = Arrays.asList(42);
            String s = l[0].get(0);     // ClassCastException
        }
    }

NB! Java does not allow the creation of arrays of parameter types; after type erasure at compile time

    public class ArrayBuilder {

        public static void addToList(List listArg, Object[] elements) {
            for (T x : elements) {
                listArg.add(x);
            }
        }

        public static void faultyMethod(List[]... l) {
            Object[] objectArray = l;   // valid
            objectArray[0] = Arrays.asList(42);
            String s = l[0].get(0);     // ClassCastException
        }
    }

### Develop a generic method
See example

### Bound type parameters
See example

### Multiple bounds on the same parameter
When a bound is a concrete type it must be the first declared bound. The rest may be any number of interfaces.

    class Parametrized<T extends Type & Interface1 & ... & InterfaceN> {}

## Java IO
### Byte Streams
- abstract superclass of streams of bytes: InputStream, OutputStream
- byte streams perform input and output on 8-bit bytes
- FileInputStream, FileOutputStream

### Character Streams
>Java platform stores character values using Unicode conventions

- abstract superclass of streams of characters: Reader, Writer
- character streams perform input and output on characters in the format of the local character set
- FileReader, FileWriter
- InputStreamReader, InputStreamWriter: byte-to-character bridge streams; wrapper around byte streams

### Buffered Streams
- buffered wrapper over unbuffered streams
- BufferedInputStream and BufferedOutputStream to wrap byte streams
- BufferedReader and BufferedWriter to wrap character streams

### Scanning
- wrapper for buffered streams to break input into tokens.


        try (Scanner s = new Scanner(new BufferedReader(new FileReader("xanadu.txt")))) {
            while (s.hasNext()) {
                System.out.println(s.next());
            }
        }

### Formatting
- PrintStream is a byte stream class, such are System.out and System.err
- PrintWriter is a character stream class

### Data Streams
- Interfaces are DataInput, DataOutput
- common implementations are DataInputStream, DataOutputStream
- supports primitive types and Strings


        DataOutput out = new DataOutputStream(new BufferedOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(dataFile)));
        DataInput in = new DataInputStream(new BufferedInputStream(new FileInputStream(dataFile)));

### Object Streams
- supports I/O for Objects implementing the marker interface `Serializable`
- interfaces are ObjectInput, ObjectOutput
- implementing classes are ObjectInputStream, ObjectOutputStream
- a single stream can contain a single copy of an object, and multiple references to it.
- object stream interfaces are sub-interfaces of data streams, thus objects with primitive fields are also supported

### Object serialization
> Do not implement Serializable lightly, since it restricts future flexibility, and publicly exposes class implementation details which are usually private

- `private static final long serialVersionUID` for versioning; changing the value makes it incompatible with previously serialized instances.
- `transient` fields are not serialized

#### Effective Java Comments
- Classes designed for inheritance (Item 17) should rarely implement Serializable, and interfaces should rarely extend it. /Effective Java/
- Consider using a custom serialized form - detach physical representation from logical content
- implement own readObject, writeObject methods, start with call to defaultReadObject, defaultWriteObject
- implement readObject defensively

        public class SerializeMe implements Serializable {
            private int something;
            ...

            /**
             * Although private, part of the interface, write javadoc.
             *
             * @SerialData describe serialized data.
             */
            private void writeObject(ObjectOutputStream outStream) {
                outStream.defaultWriteObject();
                outStream.writeInt(soemthing)
                ...
            }

            private void readObject(ObjectInputStream inStream) {
                inStream.defaultReadObject();
                // same order as write!
                something = inStream.readInt();
                ...
            }

        }

- treat readObject as a constructor
- serialization proxy pattern
    on serializing the outer class it is replaced by its proxy via writeReplace(); on deserializing the proxy class, object returned by the deserialization is replaced by the outer class created in readResolve() using data deserialized into the proxy:

        public class SerializeMe implements Serializable {
            private int state;
            ...

            Object writeReplace() throws ObjectStreamException {
                return new SerializationProxy(state);
            }

            private void readObject(ObjectInputStream instream) throws InvalidObjectException {
                throw new InvalidObjectException("proxy required");
            }

            private static SerializationProxy implements Serializable {
                private int proxyState;
                ...

                Object readResolve() throws ObjectStreamException {
                    return new SerializeMe(proxyState);
                }
            }
        }

    **NB!** limitations: not compatible with classes extendable by their clients; not compatible if object graph contains circularities - at consruction time only the proxy is available, not the actual object, calls will result in ClassCastException.

### Know the basics of the new I/O
#### Path
- in NIO.2 File is replaced with Path
- Path is the primary entry point for NIO.2

#### Files
- Files class operates on Path instances


        Charset charset = Charset.forName("US-ASCII");
        String s = ...;
        try (BufferedWriter writer = Files.newBufferedWriter(file, charset)) {
            writer.write(s, 0, s.length());
        } catch (IOException x) {
            System.err.format("IOException: %s%n", x);
        }

#### Reading small files

        Path file = ...;
        byte[] fileArray;
        fileArray = Files.readAllBytes(file);
        ...
        Files.write(file, buf);

##### Buffered IO for text files

        Charset charset = Charset.forName("US-ASCII");
        try (BufferedReader reader = Files.newBufferedReader(file, charset)) {
            String line = null;
            while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
                System.out.println(line);
            }
        } catch (IOException x) {
            System.err.format("IOException: %s%n", x);
        }

## Logging
### Logging Frameworks
- JUL (Java.Util.Logging)
- LOG4J
- Logback
- SLF4J

### JUL
- Avoid like the plague
- get logger instance: `Logger.getLogger(String)`
- logging levels
    - info
    - warning
    - fine
    - finer
    - finest
    - no debug, no trace
- default config file: `JAVA_HOME/lib/logging.properties`
- custom config: `java -Djava.util.logging.config.file=mylogging.properties`
- configuration items
    - handlers responsible for outputting log messages: `java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler` and `java.util.logging.FileHandler`
    - root log level: `.level= INFO`
    - specific logger log level: `com.xyz.foo.level= SEVERE`
    - log level set on handlers: `java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler.level= INFO`

### Log4J
- logger instance: Logger.getLogger(MyClass.class)
- logging levels
    - trace
    - debug
    - info
    - warn
    - error
    - fatal
- configuration
    - via system property: `log4j.configuration=myConfigFile`
    - via file on classpath: `log4j.properties`
- configuration items
    - loggers are assigned an appender and a log level


            log4j.<root logger>=<Logging level>, <Appender name>
            log4j.logger.com.eggs= INFO, stdout

    - appender configuration

            log4j.appender.stdout=org.apache.log4j.ConsoleAppender
            log4j.appender.stdout.Target=System.out
            log4j.appender.stdout.layout=org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout
            log4j.appender.stdout.layout.ConversionPattern= %d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss} %-5p %c{1}:%L - %m%n

### Logback
- dependencies: `logback-core` and `logback-classic`
- logger instance: `LoggerFactory.getLogger(String)`
- native slf4j implemetation
- logging levels
    - trace
    - debug
    - info
    - warn
    - error
- logger hierarchy according by `.`-s in logger name
- logging level is inherited down the hierarchy, inherited level is overridden by explicitly declared level
- appenders are inherited down the hierarchy in an additive manner (unless additivity is explicitly declared false)

    | Logger | Explicit Setting | Appenders |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | root | A | A |
    | x  | - | A |
    | x.y  | A1 | A, A1 |
    | x.y.z  | A2 | A, A1, A2 |

- logback config files, in order of precedence
    - logback.groovy on classpath
    - logback-test.xml on classpath
    - logback.xml on classpath
    - automatic configuration
- logback config items

        <configuration>
          <appender name="STDOUT" 
          class="ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender">
            <encoder>
              <pattern> ... </pattern>
            </encoder>
          </appender>
          <root level="debug">
            <appender-ref ref="STDOUT" />
          </root>
          <logger name="foo.bar" level="info" />
        </configuration>
- logback appender pattern
    - %c{length} name of logger
    - %d{pattern} date
    - %caller{depth} ~stack trace
    - %L line number of logging event
    - %M method name

### Slf4j
- Simple Logging Facade for Java
- default implementation: NOP logger
- native implementations: Logback, Simple Logger
- common API for various implementation
- bridge translates slf4j api calls to other logger implementations; include on classpath
    - SLF4J_api
    - xxx_over_SLF4J bridge or JUL_to_SLF4 (requires programmatic hijacking of JUL)
    - xxx implementation
- adapters convert various logger implementation calls to slf4j api calls - provides unified logger config via slf4j api; include on classpath
    - SLF4J_api
    - SLF4J_xxx adapter
    - xxx implementation

## Regular Expressions
### Cheat Sheet
#### Modifiers
- `/i` case insensitive
- `/g` global - match as many times as possible
- `/m` multiline - line beginning `^` and end `$` anchors on a per line basis

#### Anchors
- `^` start of line
- `$` end of line
- `\b` word boundary
    
#### Character groups
- `[a-z]` range
- `[^a-z]` everything but the range a..z
- `\w` word character
- `\d` number character
- `\s` white space
- `\W` **everything but** word character, same as `[^\w]`
- `\D` **everything but** number character, same as `[^\d]`
- `\S` **everything but** white space, same as `[^\s]`
- `.` any character

#### Modifiers
- `?` 0 times or once
- `+` at least once
- `*` zero or more times
- `{n}` n times
- `{n,}` at least n times
- `{n,m}` minimum n, maximum m times
- `{,m}` maximum m times

#### Greedy vs. Lazy matching
- `.*`, `.+`, `.?` are greedy, they match as much as possible
- appending a `?`, like `.*?` gives lazy modifiers matching as little as possible

#### Groups
- `(...)` capturing group
- `(?: ...)` non capturing group

#### Escaped literals
- `\.`
- `\$`
- `\^`
- `\/`
- `\+`
- `\*`
- `\?`

### Use the Pattern and Matcher classes
- compile expression with Pattern to produce Matcher
- Matcher can try to match whole string, iterate over groups.
- Matcher is stateful
