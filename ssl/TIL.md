# Keytool
> Java does not keep keys and certificates as individual files; rather it bundles them all in a single storage facility called a keystore. In order to manipulate the contents of a keystore, you will need to use keytool, which is included with every Java Development Kit (JDK).

# Java Root Certificate Store
> A TLS library is not very useful on the public Internet without a collection of trusted certificates, which are known as roots or root certificates. A collection of root certificates is also called a truststore. JVM vendors typically maintain their own truststores and ship them with their products.
