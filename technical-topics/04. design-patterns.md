# Design Patterns
- Design patterns provide a shared vocabulary for common problems and proven solutions
    - implies constraints and charactersitics
    - more concise than ad-hoc description
- Allows to think of a problem from a more abstract angle; design patterns are more high level than libraries and frameworks

## Creational patterns
- `new` creates concrete as opposed to 'program to interfaces'
- `new` makes testing more difficult, can cause coupling problems

### Builder
TODO!

### Factory
- Factory is not a design pattern, but a good starting point for factory method and abstract factory
- provides a single point for object creation
- allows client code to rely on interface without knowing conccrete implementation 

            public class SimplePizzaFactory implements PizzaFactory{
                public Pizza createPizza(Enum<T extends PizzaType> pizzaType) {
                    Pizza pizza = null;
                    if (CHEESE.equals(pizzaType)) pizza = new CheesePizza();
                    else if (PEPPERONI.equals(pizzaType)) pizza = new PepperoniPizza();
                    else if (GREEK.equals(pizzaType)) pizza = new GreekPizza();
                    return pizza;
                }
            }

client example

            public class PizzaStore {
                private final PizzaFactory factory;

                public PizzaStore(PizzaFactory factory) {
                    this.factory = factory;
                }

                public Pizza orderPizza(PizzaType pizzaType) {
                    return processForOrdering(factory.createPizza(pizzaType));
                }

                private Pizza processForOrdering(Pizza pizza) {
                    //...
                }
            }

### Static Factory Method
Factory's create pizza as a static method
    - no need for an instance to invoke createPizza
    - cannot override createPizza in subclass

### Factory Method
- Factory method defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which implementation to create;
- Factory method deferes instantiation to subclases
- example is like a chain of franchise pizza stores - they decide on how to create the pizza, but packaging, slicing, delivery are the same

### Abstract Factory
- provides an interface for creating a family of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes

### Abstract Factory vs. Factory Method
| Abstract Factory | Factory Method |
| --- | --- |
| Creates a set of dependent or related objects | Creates a single object |
| Client delegates creation to factory object | Client has an interface to own (abstract) factory method |
| Client knows the abstract factory interface and the abstract products | Client knows the abstract product and the interface of the factory method |
| Client is injected the concrete factory object that creates the concrete products | Concrete Client subclasses abstract supertype and implements concrete factory method |

### Singleton *anti-*pattern
- one instance only; private constructor, reference is retrieved via static `getInstance()` method;
- with eager initialization
    
        public class Singleton {
            private static Singleton INSTANCE = new Singleton();

            private Singleton() {
                // initilize state
            }

            public static getInstance() {
                return INSTANCE;
            }
        }

- with lazy initialization and double check locking

        public class Singleton {
            private static volatile Singleton INSTANCE;

            private Singleton() {
                // initialize state
            }

            public static getInstance() {
                if (INSTANCE == null) {
                    synchronized(Singleton) {
                        if (INSTANCE == null) {
                            INSTANCE = new Singleton();
                        }
                    }
                }
                return INSTANCE;
            }
        }

- lazy initialization with holder
    - lazy: inner static class is initialized only on first access
    - thread safe: class initialization is guaranteed by JVM to be serial

            public class Singleton {

                private Singleton() {
                    // initialize state
                }

                public static getInstance() {
                    return Holder.INSTANCE;
                }

                private static class Holder {
                    private static final Singleton INSTANCE = new Singleton();
                }
            }

- Effective Java: enum based singletons

        public enum Singleton {
            INSTANCE;

            public void do(String arg) {
                // do something with argument
            }
        }

#### Singleton is evil
- violates *Single Responsibility Principle*: manages own lifecycle plus whatever it is intended to do
- global state
- hides dependencies - accessed via class method, not passed around as parameter
- increases coupling 
- cannot be mocked, difficult to test its clients
- singletons are not explicitly disposed of - they carry state for the whole lifecycle of the app

## Structural Patterns  
### Adapter
- converts the interface of a class into another interface a client expects
- always converts the interface
- does not add behaviour
- lets otherwise incompatible classes work togoether
- it is not the number of components that are wrapped – could be multiple; defining characteristic of the adapter is the intent to convert interfaces

    public class EnumerationAdapter implements Iterator {
        private Enumeration enumeration;

        public EnumerationAdapter(Enumeration enumeration) {
            this.enumeration = enumeration;
        }

        public boolean hasNext() {
            return enumeration.hasMoreElements();
        }

        public Object next() {
            return enumeration.nextElement();
        }

        public void remove() {
            throw new UnsupportedOperationException();
        }
    }

### Decorator
- attaches additional responsibility dynamically to existing objects by composition without making changes to the underlying class
- decorators have the same supertype as the decorated object; thus the wrapped object can be passed around in the same manner as the original one
- decorators add their own behaviour before, after or both after delegating to the wrapped object
- decorators are meant to be transparent; this is not the right pattern, if the assembled concrete object relies on the type of its components
- because more object have to be managed it is good practice to create decrated objects with Factories or Builders
- `Hamburger Whopper = new BigBun(new Patty(new Lettuce(new Pickles(new Ketchup(null)))));`
- `InputStream is = new LineNumberInputStream(new BufferedInputStream(new FileInputStream(fileName)));`

            }

### Facade
- provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem
- defines a higher-level abstraction, makes it easier to use the subsystem
- it is not the number of components the facade unifies – could be a single one; defining characteristic of the facade is the intent to simplify
- does not encapsulate subsystem classes, they remain directly accessible to client

### Adapter vs. Decorator vs. Facade

| Adapter | Decorator | Facade |
| --- | --- | --- |
| changes interface of wrapped class | interface remains unchanged | simplified interface for a subsystem |
| change interface, keep behaviour | keep interface, change behaviour | simplify interface |
| wrapped classes get new interface | classes are wrapped in a transparent manner | wrapped classes remain directly accessible |

### Bridge
TODO!

### Proxy
TODO!

### Adapter vs. Decorator vs. Proxy
TODO!

### Composite
- composes objects into tree tsructures to represent whole-part relationships
- lets the client treat individual objects and composition of objects uniformly

              +-------------------+                     .
                        A                               .
                        |                               .    
               +--------+-----------+                   .    
               |                    |                   .

                          +-------------------+

- `Client` uses the Component interface
- `Leaf` has no children, defines behaviour for the elements in the composition
- `Composite` defines behaviour of components with children, stores children
- drawback: Component cotains methods for both leafs and composites; Leaf and Composite have to implement methods that might not make sense
    - tradeoff for transparency - that is being able to treat leafs and composites uniformly

## Behavioural patterns 
### Command
- encapsulates requests as objects, letting other object be parametrized with them

        +---------------+                  +---------------------+ 
        | <<interface>> |                  | Invoker             |
        | Command       |<.....HAS-A.......+---------------------+
        +---------------+                  | setCommand(Command) |
        | execute()     |                  +---------------------+
        +---------------+
                A        
                |        
       +-----------------+                      +----------+
       | ConcreteCommand |..invokes.action.on..>| Receiver |
       +-----------------+                      +----------+
                .                                           
                .                                           
                public void execute() {
                    receiver.action();
                }                      

- `Command`: abstraction that encapsulates an action into an object
- `Concrete Command`: has reference to Receiver on which `action()` is invoked by `execute()`                                                             
- `Invoker`: invoker has a command, calls `command.execute()`
- `Receiver`: has the action that is encapsulated into the command
- `Client`: is responsible for instantiating `ConcreteCommand` and setting its receiver

        // receiver
        public class ToggleSwitch {
            pubic void toggle() {
                //...
            }
        }

        // command
        public interface Command {
            void execute();
        }

        // concrete command
        public class ToggleSwitchCommand implements Commmand {
            private ToggleSwitch receiver;

            public ToggleSwitchCommand(ToggleSwitch receiver) {
                this.receiver = receiver;
            }

            public void execute() {
                receiver.toggle();
            }
        }

        // invoker
        public class RemoteControl {
            private Command command;

            public RemoteControl() {
                command = new NoCommand();
            }

            public onButtonPress() {
                command.execute();
            }

            public void setCommand(Command command) {
                this.command = command;
            }
        }

        // client
        public class Client {
            public static void main(String[] args) {
                Command switchCommand = new ToggleSwitchCommand(new ToggleSwitch());
                RemoteControl remoteControl = new RemoteControl();
                remoteControl.setCommand(switchCommand);

                remoteControl.onButtonPress();
            }
        }

#### MacroCommand
- A command thatexecutes a number of other commands

        public class MacroCommand implements Command {
            private Command[] commands;

            public MacroCommand(Command[] commands) {
                this.commands = commmands;
            }

            public void execute() {
                for(Command command : commands) {
                    command.execute();
                }
            }
        }

#### More uses of the command pattern
- queuing: job queue contains commands - decoupled form the actual receivers
- logging requests - store operations on disk by serializing commands

### Iterator
- provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation
- it places the task of the traversal on the iterator object, not on the aggregate object
- iterators imply no ordering – depends on concrete iterator and aggregate object implementation


### Mediator
TODO!

### Observer
Defines a one-to-many dependency so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified

            public interface Observer {
                void update();
            }

            public interface Subject {
                void registerObserver(Observer observer);
                void removeObserver(Observer observer);
                void notifyAll();
            }

            public class ConcreteSubject implements Subject {
                private List<Observer> observers = new ArrayList<>();
                private State state;

                public void registerObserver(Observer observer){
                    observers.add(observer);
                }

                public void removeObserver(Observer observer){
                    observers.remove(observer);
                }

                public void notifyAll(){
                    for(Observer observer : Observers) {
                        observer.update(state);
                    }
                }

                public State getState() {
                    return state;
                }

                public void setState(State state) {
                    this.state = state
                    notifyAll();
                }

            }

            public class ConcreteObserver implements Observer {
                public void update(Object state) {
                    display(state);
                }

                private void display(Object state) {
                    System.out.println("new state: " + state);
                }

            }

- observers register with concrete subjects to receive updates
- state could also have been pulled instead of pushed
- subjects and observers are loosely coupled

Java has built in Observable supertype and Observer interface - extending might not be the best of options

### Strategy
Defines a family of interchangeable algorithm; decouples algorithm from its client

            public abstract class Duck {
                private QuackStrategy quackStrategy;

                public Duck(QuackStrategy quackStrategy) {
                    this.quackStrategy = quackStrategy;
                }

                public void quack() {
                    quackStrategy.quack();
                }

                public abstract void display();
            } 

            public interface QuackStrategy {
                void quack();
            }

            public class Quack implements QuackStrategy {
                @Override
                public void quack() {
                    System.out.println("quack!");
                }
            }

            public class Squeek implements QuackStrategy {
                @Override
                public void quack() {
                    System.out.println("squeek!")
                }
            }

Implementations with concrete Quack Strategies

            public class RubberDuck extends Duck {
                public RubberDuck() {
                    super(new Squeek());
                }

                @Override
                public void display() {
                    System.out.println("I'm a rubber duck!");
                }
            }

            public class Mallard extends Duck {
                public Mallard() {
                    super(new Quack());
                }

                @Override
                public void display() {
                    System.out.println("I'm a mallard!");
                }
            }


### Template Method
- defines a skeleton of an algorithm in a method
- deferres some steps to methods to be implemented by subclasses
- lets subclasses alter some steps without changing the algorithm structure
- algorithm skeleton is protected by `final`
- hook is a concrete method that initially does nothing, may optionally be overridden in subclass

        public abstract class AbstractTemplate {
            public final void templateMethod() {
                primitiveOperation1();
                primitiveOperation2();
                concreteOperation();
                hook();
            }

            protected abstract void primitiveOperation1();

            protected abstract void primitiveOperation2();

            private void concreteOperation() {
                // do something concrete...
            }

            protected void hook() {}
        }

### Template Method vs. Strategy vs. Factory Method

| Template Method | Strategy | Factory Method |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Subclasses decide how to implement steps of an algorithm | encapsulates interchangable behaviours and uses delegation to decide which one to use | Subclasses decide which concrete class to create |
| operates with subclassing | operates with composition | operates with subclassing |
| defers elements of the algorithm | delegates an entire algorithm | |

## Design Principles
### Strategy
- encapsulate aspects of the code that varies and separate them from what stays the same
- Program to interfaces, not implementations
    instead of

        Dog dog = new Dog();
        dog.bark();

    consider

        Animal animal = getAnimal();
        animal.makeSound();

- Favor composition over inheritance
    composition allows to change behaviour at runtime

### Observer
- strive for loosely coupled design between interacting objects; they handle change better because they know little about each other, thus minimizing interdependency between them

### Decorator
- Open-Closed Principle: classes should be open to extension, closed for modification
    - areas of code that need to be extended have to be chosen carefully
    - applying the open-closed principles blindly adds unnecessary complexity to the code

### Factories
- Dependency Inversion Principle
    - Depend on abstractions, not on concrete classes
    - stronger statement than coding to interfaces: high level components should not depend on low level components; instead both should depend on abstractions

    - example
        - before: every pizza creation is inside PizzaStore, thus it depends on NYCheesePizza, NYVeggiePizza, NYPepperoniPizza, CalifCheesePizza, CalifVeggiePizza, CalifPepperoniPizza
        - after applying the factory method, both PizzaStore and the various Pizza implementations depend on the abstraction Pizza

### Adapter, Decorator, Facade
- *Law* of Demeter or Principle of Least Knowledge – talk only to your immediate friends
    - methods of components
    - own methods
    - methods of parameters 
    - method on objects created within the object

### Template Method
- The Hollywood Principle: don't call us, we'll call you; low-level components hook themselves into the system, high level components decide when to call them. E.g: implementations of the abstract operations are called by the template method in the abstract class, never vica-versa

### Iterator
- Single responsibility principle: a class should have a only one reason to change
    - example: if a collection were responsible for the iteration too, it would then have two resons to change:
        1. if the collection changes
        2. if the way we iterate changes
    - *cohesion*: the measure of how closely a class supports a single purpose
        - high cohesion: class is designed around a set of related functions
        - low cohesion: a class is **not** designed around a **single** set of related function
    - classes that adhere to the single responsibility principle tend to have a higher cohesion, they are more maintainable
